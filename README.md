# MTGCollector

MTGCollector is a SPA (Single Page Application) that let's you view cards from a Manabox collection .csv file. I've found the Manabox application incredibly useful during my card scanning journey, but wanted to have a way to view my card collection on the computer, hence this project.

## How to use

1. Open index.htm with your favorite browser, alternatively use the live version [here](https://8bitmcu.github.io/mtgcollector).
2. Upload your manabox .csv file, or try the demo link
3. You should be able to browse by edition and search by name!
